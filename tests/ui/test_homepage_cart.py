"""Homepage cart interaction tests: add-to-cart messaging, cart count, and max quantity state.

These UI tests sometimes need to manipulate server state (e.g., reset the cart) to
start from a clean baseline. Playwright exposes HTTP capabilities via an
`APIRequestContext` type, which we can obtain in two common ways:

- In API-focused tests, we receive an `api_request_context` fixture directly and pass
  it to helpers like `reset_cart(api_request_context)`.
- In UI-focused tests, we don't have that fixture, but each `Page` exposes an
  `APIRequestContext` at `page.request`. We can pass that into the same helpers, e.g.,
  `reset_cart(page.request)`. Both satisfy the same interface and behave equivalently.

Using the shared helper keeps assertions (e.g., expecting OK status) and endpoint
paths centralized in `utils/api_helpers.py`, so we donâ€™t duplicate those details in
every test.
