# utils/api_helpers.py
"""Helpers for interacting with cart-related API endpoints in Playwright tests.

These helpers accept Playwright's `APIRequestContext`, which is the same type used to
perform HTTP requests in tests. There are two typical ways you will obtain an
`APIRequestContext`:

1. API tests: use the `api_request_context` fixture provided by the Playwright
   test runner. Example:

       reset_cart(api_request_context)

2. UI tests: access the request context off a `Page` instance via `page.request`.
   Example:

       reset_cart(page.request)

Both values implement the same interface and work identically with these helpers.
Centralizing common actions here ensures consistent status assertions and request
shapes across all tests.
